        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Patishapta is a quintessential winter treat. It falls in the category of pitha/pithe! Bengali Pitha or Pithe are special types of 
            Bengali sweets that are typically prepared using seasonal harvest. There is a special day in January when we celebrate Makar Sankranti. 
            It is our harvest festival and Patishapta is prepared on that day. Having said that, Patishapta pitha is one such Bengali desert that 
            I prepare all year round because it’s so easy and quick!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>75g of semolina</li>
            <li>150g of plain flour</li>
            <li>400ml of milk</li>
            <li>50ml of water</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of sugar</li>
            <li>1 cinnamon stick, small</li>
            <li>6 cardamom pods</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>200g of desiccated coconut</li>
            <li>1 tsp ghee</li>
            <li>225g of date molasses</li>
            <li>4 tbsp of oil, to brush the pan</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mix together the semolina and flours with milk and water. Add the salt and sugar and whisk until smooth. 
            Cover and leave to rest for 1 hour</li>

            <li>Meanwhile, make the filling. Bring 500ml of water to the boil with the cinnamon, cardamom and bay leaf. Mix in the 
            coconut and reduce the heat to low. Cook for 15–18 minutes, stirring regularly until the coconut has softened and 
            absorbed all the water. Take off the heat and set aside</li>

            <li>Melt the ghee over a medium heat in a frying pan. Once the ghee has melted, add the coconut and molasses and cook for 
            8–10 minutes on a very low heat, until the molasses has blended with the coconut and the mixture has turned soft but 
            still falls easily off a spoon. Take off the heat and transfer the mixture to a dish and leave to cool for at least 
            30 minutes</li>

            <li>Heat a flat griddle pan or cast-iron tawa pan over a low heat and brush lightly with oil. Add a small ladle of batter 
            to the pan, swirling as you go, to create a thin crêpe. Cook for 1–1 ½ minutes until pale golden on the underside and 
            place roughly 2 tbsp of the coconut filling across the centre in a thick vertical line or log shape</li>

            <li>Use a spatula to flip over one side of the crêpe to cover the filling and then flip the other side over the covered 
            filling (like an envelope). Repeat until you use up all the batter, greasing the pan after cooking every patishapta. 
            Remove from the pan and keep warm as you cook the rest</li>

            <li>Scatter with finely crushed pistachios and rose petals with some pouring cream on top, if desired</li>
        </ol>
