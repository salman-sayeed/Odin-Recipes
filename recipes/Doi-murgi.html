        <h1>Doi murgi – Bangladeshi yoghurt chicken curry</h1>
        </div>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This classic chicken dish is popular in Bangladesh and a real treat on days when you feel like indulging or just require 
            comfort food. Doi, or yoghurt, adds a delicious creaminess and the layering of spices ensures the dish is flavourful 
            throughout. Large chunks of marinated chicken are added to a base of spiced, caramelised onions. One of the reasons 
            this recipe is special is that it is cooked with mustard oil, which is a staple in the Bangladeshi kitchen and imparts 
            a unique aroma and taste. Because the dish is rich and creamy it is best served with plain boiled rice and a wedge of 
            lime on the side.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1kg boneless chicken thighs, skinned and cut into large pieces</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 tsp garlic, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tsp ginger, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper, crushed</li>
            <li>2 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder</li>
            <li>2 tsp lemon juice</li>
            <li>250g of Greek yoghurt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cumin powder</li>
            <li>5 tbsp mustard oil</li>
            <li>3 medium onions, finely sliced</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>6 cardamom pods</li>
            <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>8 cloves</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cumin powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp turmeric powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp chilli powder</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp ground mace</li>
            <li>6 green chillies</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the chicken in a bowl with all the ingredients listed for the marinade. Mix together well and chill in the 
                fridge, preferably overnight or at least 2–3 hours. When you are ready to cook, remove the marinated chicken from 
                the fridge and set aside.</li>

            <li>Heat the mustard oil in a large saucepan over a medium-high heat. Add the onions, salt, bay leaves, and whole spices 
                and cook until golden brown (around 10 minutes).</li>

            <li>Add 125ml of water and bring to a simmer, then turn the heat to low and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>

            <li>When the onion mixture is soft and caramelised, add the ground spices. Turn up the heat to medium and sauté for a 
                minute or so, to cook out the spices.</li>

            <li>Take the pan off the heat and add the 6 green chillies and marinated chicken mixture, stirring everything together. 
                Add another 50ml of water.</li>
                
            <li>Set the pan back over a low heat and cover. Cook for 35–40 minutes, stirring occasionally. You should end up with a 
                fairly thick gravy, with a little oil rising to the surface.</li>

            <li>Divide into bowls, scatter with crispy shallots and a split chilli. Serve with steamed white rice and lime.</li>
