        <h1>Handesh – Bangladeshi rice flour and date molasses cakes</h1>
        </div>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Handesh are delicious fried rice flour cakes, also known as teler pitha. They’re a real celebration of rice and morcha 
            gur – the exquisite date molasses made in Bangladesh during the late autumn and winter months. These cakes belong to 
            the tradition of rice-based sweets and savouries called pitha, which are key to Bangladeshi food culture.
            Weightier than a doughnut, handesh are slightly dense and crispy around the edges. The secret is in the preparation 
            and to me there’s magic in the making. I still feel excited when I watch a pour of batter disappear into the hot oil, 
            dark against the traditional cast-iron pan. The batter rises and puffs up and a tiny frilly edge appears 
            (synonymous with good handesh), and finally takes on a deep copper hue.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>250g of date molasses</li>
            <li>400ml of lukewarm water</li>
            <li>250g of rice flour</li>
            <li>150g of plain flour</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp ground cinnamon (optional)</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp ground cardamom (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the molasses to a large mixing bowl and begin by pouring 300ml of water to start with and whisk together. The texture 
                of Bangladeshi molasses varies from a thick syrup to slightly set. I use brands such as Zilani or Akza. If the set is very 
                syrupy (like golden syrup), you will only require 300–325ml of water.</li>

            <li>Pour in the flours and spices (if using) and whisk for 3–5 minutes, until you have a smooth batter. You need to check 
                carefully for lumps, as they prevent the handesh from rising and will cause them to split. Cover the batter and rest 
                for 2 hours.</li>

            <li>After 2 hours, thoroughly whisk the batter until smooth, as the rice flour will have settled at the bottom of the bowl. 
                The batter should have a fairly thick consistency, yet remain loose enough to pour – similar to thick pancake or waffle 
                batter. It should form ribbons as you drag the whisk through it.</li>

            <li>Take a cast-iron korai or wok and add enough oil to half-fill the pan, or enough to deep-fry and turn the heat to high. 
                Once the oil is hot, reduce the heat to low–medium. Drop in a teaspoon of batter to test the oil – if it rises slowly to 
                the surface, the oil is ready.</li>

            <li>Pour batter in a quick steady stream into the centre of the pan, preferably using a Pyrex jug with a pouring spout (about 
                45ml of batter for each cake). It should rise to the surface in about 15–20 seconds and slowly puff up. If it rises too 
                quickly, turn the heat down slightly. Cook for 45 seconds, or until the underside is golden. Carefully turn over and cook 
                for a further 30–45 seconds, until golden. Make sure not to let excess batter drip into the pan as this may prevent the 
                cakes from rising, and always fry one at a time.</li>

            <li>If the batter splits while frying, whisk in 2 tablespoons of flour to the mixture and try again. You should be creating 
                handesh which are about the size of a digestive biscuit.</li>

            <li>Use a slotted spoon to remove the handesh and place on kitchen towel with the frilled edge facing down while you continue 
                frying the remaining batter. This helps retain the shape of the cakes.</li>

            <li>Enjoy hot, fresh out of the pan. Once cool, place in an airtight container overnight and in the fridge for up to a week. 
                Reheat in a warm oven for a few minutes to refresh or on a tawa or frying pan over very low heat, turning a few times.</li>
